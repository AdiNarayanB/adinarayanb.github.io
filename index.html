        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Adithya Narayan!</h1>
				
					<p style="font-size:30px;">I am a graduate student in Computer Science at Northeastern University, Boston. I graduated from Ramaiah Institute of Technology, with a Bachelor's degree in Information Science and Engineering.</p>
					<p style="font-size:30px;">I've built tools and pipelines for ML Experimentation, specifically in the building, deploying and benchmarking of Speech/Image based rule systems/Deep Learning Models.  </p>
					<p style="font-size:30px;">As an undergrad, I received the best capstone project award and represented my university's robotics team in the AUVSI SUAS, where we placed 2nd in Asia. </p>
					
					<p style="font-size:30px;">Take a look at my blog to get an idea of what I've worked on in the past, and things that I want to build/am building! Feel free to reach out to me on narayanbadanidiyoo.a@northeastern.edu or my Linkedin if you want to communicate!</p>
